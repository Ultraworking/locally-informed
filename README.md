# Locally Informed — Official Resources by Location

Covid-19 is causing considerable disruption worldwide and a lot of people don't know where to find information about the measures taken by their local governments.

We created Locally Informed to help people identify all the key information relevant to their city, state/province, and nation.

Users can go to [local.quarantinesupport.com](https://local.quarantinesupport.com) to find all their relevant official sources. This is useful for people to get dialed-in to the right information sources and for other application developers, media, and institutions to help people stay on top of announcements for their region.

We're crowdsourcing the official information by location right now — you can make a difference by adding your local data and telling others about the project. This project was led up by Ultraworking's CTO, Lee Knowlton — we're turning all our attention to helping people affected by lockdown, quarantine, and who have disrupted routines during the Pandemic.

It only takes 5-10 minutes to update data and can make a considerable difference in helping people get informed.

Our motto for this time period is "Parati Servire" — **we're here to serve.**

Thank you for helping and for spreading the word. Stay safe and strong out there,

Lee Knowlton
CTO, Ultraworking

## Updates

### 9th April 2020

- `local_region` for India has been updated from City-level to State-level.

## Directory Structure

![Directory Structure](https://i.ibb.co/5F1XZV1/Screenshot-2020-03-25-at-10-33-55-AM.png)

- **\[COUNTRY_ISO_CODE\]**: The [3-Letter ISO Alpha-3 code](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm) for the target country. (Example — `nzl` for New Zealand).
- **\[REGION_NAME\]**: For USA, this will be the 2-Letter State code. (Example — `ca` for California). For all other countries, this will be the name of the target city. Note: If the name has a space, replace that with the `_` character. (Example — `kuala_lumpur` for Kuala Lumpur City, Malaysia).

**NOTE: both the \[COUNTRY_ISO_CODE\] and \[REGION_NAME\] should be in lower case.**

## Contribution Guide — USA

You will then want to navigate to the **regions** folder. (`locally-informed/countries/usa/regions`).

### 1. Add resources to an existing data source for a State:

- Find the JSON file for the State by searching for its 2-Letter State Code. (Example — `ca.json` for California).
- Open the JSON file using a text editor and add the resources by following the file structure.
- Save the file and commit and push to a branch in your cloned repository.
- Submit a Pull Request to the **locally-informed** repository.

### 2. Create a data source and add resources for a State:

**Note: Make sure that a data source does not already exist for the State**

- Copy the `region_template.json` file from `locally-informed/templates`.
- Paste the copied `region_template.json` file into `locally-informed/countries/usa/regions`.
- Rename the file with the 2-Letter State Code. Example — `tx.json` for Texas.
- Open the template and follow the structure to add resources. You can use data sources for other States as reference.
- Save the file and commit and push to a branch in your cloned repository.
- Submit a Pull Request to the **locally-informed** repository.
